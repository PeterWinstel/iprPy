iprPy bin contents
==================

**iprPy** is the command line script for the framework.  See the package
documentation for more details and a list of the options.

The **iprPy_script** and **iprPy_slurm** files are basic example queuing
submission scripts for running iprPy commands on clusters.

**master_prepare.py** allows for multiple calculations to be prepared according
to the settings used by the NIST Interatomic Potentials Repository.  This
script allows for the high-throughput framework to be 'nearly' automatic.
