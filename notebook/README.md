# Jupyter Calculation Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that document and provide demonstrations of the calculation methods currently implemented in iprPy.  There are two types of calculation notebooks that may be present in each calculation folder:

- __Methodology and code__ notebooks provide a single documentation source per calculation describing each calculation's methodology, copies of the calculation code, and a working demonstration.  These correspond to the notebooks in the older iprPy versions.
- __Python class__ notebooks describe the calculation methodology and the iprPy Calculation class associated with each calculation.  They provide a demonstration of how to use the Calculation objects to run the calculations and process the results from within Python.  This type of notebook is currently only available for some of the calculations.
