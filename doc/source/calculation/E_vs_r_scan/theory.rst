Method and Theory
-----------------

An initial system (and corresponding unit cell system) is supplied. The
:math:`r/a` ratio is identified from the unit cell. The system is then
uniformly scaled to all :math:`r_i` values in the range to be explored
and the energy for each is evaluated using LAMMPS and “run 0” command,
i.e. no relaxations are performed.

In identifying energy minima along the curve, only the explored values
are used without interpolation. In this way, the possible energy minima
structures are identified for :math:`r_i` where
:math:`E(r_i) < E(r_{i-1})` and :math:`E(r_i) < E(r_{i+1})`.
