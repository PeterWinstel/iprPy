Introduction
============

The **stacking_fault_map_2D** calculation style evaluates the full 2D
generalized stacking fault map for an array of shifts along a specified
crystallographic plane. A regular grid of points is established and the
generalized stacking fault energy is evaluated at each.

Version notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  2018-07-09: Notebook added.
-  2019-07-30: Description updated and small changes due to iprPy
   version.
-  2020-05-22: Version 0.10 update - potentials now loaded from
   database.
-  2020-09-22: Calculation updated to use atomman.defect.StackingFault
   class. Setup and parameter definition streamlined.

   disclaimers <http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm>`__
-  The systemâ€™s dimension perpendicular to the fault plane should be
   large to minimize the interaction of the free surface and the
   stacking fault.
