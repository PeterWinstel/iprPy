Introduction
============

The **stacking_fault_map_2D** calculation style evaluates the full 2D
generalized stacking fault map for an array of shifts along a specified
crystallographic plane. A regular grid of points is established and the
generalized stacking fault energy is evaluated at each.

Version notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This was previously called the stacking_fault_multi calculation and
   was renamed for clarity.

-  The systemâ€™s dimension perpendicular to the fault plane should be
   large to minimize the interaction of the free surface and the
   stacking fault.
