Introduction
============

The crystal_space_group calculation style characterizes a bulk atomic
system (configuration) by determining its space group by evaluating
symmetry elements of the box dimensions and atomic position. This is
useful for analyzing relaxed systems to determine if they have
transformed to a different crystal structure. An ideal unit cell based
on the identified space group and the systemâ€™s box dimensions is also
generated.

-  The results are sensitive to the symmetryprecision parameter as it
   defines the tolerance for identifying which atomic positions and box
   dimensions are symmetrically equivalent. A small symmetryprecision
   value may be able to differentiate between ideal and distorted
   crystals, but it will cause the calculation to fail if smaller than
   the variability in the associated system properties.
