Introduction
============

The reference_crystal record style defines a crystal structure as
obtained from an external database.

Version notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  iprPy version 0.9: this record style was created to replace the
   previous folder of reference crystals in poscar format. This makes it
   possible to store and access the reference crystals using the
   database.
