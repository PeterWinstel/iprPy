Introduction
============

The crystal_prototype record style is used for representing crystal
prototypes contained within the iprPy reference library. The style is
consistent with the atomman system_model format, but lacks
element/symbol information and only has atom sites in cell-relative
parameters.

Version notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  iprPy version 0.9: the contained atomic system configuration was
   updated to the new atomman.System model format.
