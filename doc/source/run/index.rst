Calculations
============

The iprPy framework is designed around running calculations.  Each implemented
calculation can be accessed and executed in a variety of ways allowing for the
calculations to be easily used for different situations.  Each calculation
exists in two forms: a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook.  The functions in
the Jupyter Notebook are copied directly from the Python script to ensure that
the code remains consistent.

Additionally, high-throughput capabilities are built around the Python scripts
allowing numerous runs to be prepared and executed in series.
