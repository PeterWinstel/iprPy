==================================
Run a Jupyter Calculation Notebook
==================================

The calculation Notebooks can be found in the iprPy/Notebook directory.  Static
HTML copies can also be viewed in the iprPy online documentation.

Each Notebook provides a complete, self-contained documentation of the
calculation.  The primary components of each Notebook consist of

#. Introduction and description of the calculation.

#. An in-depth discussion of the calculation's methods and theory.

#. Calculation input parameter setup.  This details the different inputs used
   by the calculation and how they are defined.

#. The working calculation functions, which are identical to the corresponding
   functions in the associated Python calculation scripts.

#. A simple display of the calculation's results.
